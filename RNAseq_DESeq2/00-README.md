# RNA-Seq analysis in three cell lines (Ant, Bat, and DOG) when Calcoco2 is knocked down

- Mapping RNA-Seq reads to GRCh38, downloaded from ENSEMBL v101, using STAR (2.7.9a)

- Gene expression counting using featureCounts (v2.0.3)

- Differential expression using DESeq2 in R (v1.36.0)

- Visualization (scatter and bar plot) using seaborn in python.
